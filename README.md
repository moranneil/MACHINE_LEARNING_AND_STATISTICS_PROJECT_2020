# MACHINE LEARNING AND STATISTICS PROJECT 2021
***

This is my Machine leanrning and Statistics project submission for a Webapplication that predictes power values for a give wind speed that is entered on the webpage. The application uses machine learning algorithms that initially train on a given sample dataset. 

The sections in the Jupyter notebook are as follows:

***
## 1. Importing and Analysing the Dataset
***

In this section the dataset is imported from a CSV file and the the data is plotted and initial observations are made

***
## 2. Algorithms
***

Two algorithms are coded up data is analysed for both algorithms using plots and calculations. Both algorithms are run on the RAW dataset and the dataset that has been cleaned

***
## 3. Web Application and Python Functions
***

In the 3rd section the components of the Web application is described. Instructions are given on how to run the application. And Finally sample wind speed values are entered in to the webapplication to demonstarate that it does work and also the differences between the algorithms that are used.
