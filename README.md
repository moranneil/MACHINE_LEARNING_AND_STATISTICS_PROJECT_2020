# MACHINE LEARNING AND STATISTICS PROJECT 2021

This is my machine learning and statistics project submission for a web application that predictes power values for a given wind speed. The wind speed is entered on the webpage of the application and it returns the predicted power for that wind speed. The application uses machine learning algorithms that initially train on a given  wind speed/power output dataset. 

The sections in the Jupyter notebook are as follows:

***
## 1. Importing and Analysing the Dataset

In this section the dataset is imported from a CSV file and the the data is plotted and initial observations are made.

***
## 2. Algorithms

Two algorithms are coded up, predicted data is analysed form both algorithms using plots and calculations. Both algorithms are run on the RAW dataset and the dataset that has been cleaned

***
## 3. Web Application and Python Functions

In the 3rd section the components of the Web application is described. Instructions are given on how to run the application. Finally sample wind speed values are entered in to the web application to demonstarate that it does work and also the differences between the algorithms that are used.
